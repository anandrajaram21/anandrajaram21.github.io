First off, whoami? Well, I am Anand Rajaram. I am a student of Class 12 studying in Bangalore, India. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language i ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and JavaScript.  

My first introduction to computer science was surprisingly through a prank on Facebook. This was when I was 13 years old. It was a post that said "Run the following command in your macOS terminal to hack anyone's Facebook password `sudo rm -rf /`". I ran this on my dad's Mac, and there began my journey into computer science. Luckily my dad had a Time Machine backup, so everything was back to normal. I eventually started to explore what that command actually did, and got into learning Linux. After that, I just continued to learn whatever excited me the most then. 

Fast forward to April, 2021, when I started to explore the world of cybersecurity. Everything here was so damn interesting, that I just could not stop learning more. The world of CTFs caught my eye. I went ahead and tried my hand at a few web CTFs, as I had some prior web development experience. I failed at most of them, but isn't that how we all learn? Within the span of one month, I learnt more about web app security, binary exploitation and other CTF topics, and was soon able to solve beginner level CTF challenges, and some harder ones too!

This blog will contain writeups to CTF challenges that I was able to solve, or ones that I found particularly interesting. These will explain everything from a beginners perspective, so as to make it easy to understand for everyone who has a background in tech.
