By inspecting the network tab in the chrome dev tools during the initial page load, we see that a get request is made to /api/status?verbose=. On accessing that page with the verbose parameter set to true, it gives us a list of api endpoints, one of which was /api/rocketLaunch/. On sending a POST request to that route with the required parameters, it asks us for a &amp;ldquo;frontend authorization token&amp;rdquo; for which we have to dig into the website source code.</description></item><item><title>Git Good</title><link>https://anandrajaram21.github.io/blog/git-good/</link><pubDate>Thu, 20 May 2021 22:49:23 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://anandrajaram21.github.io/blog/git-good/</guid><description>Problem Statement TLDR The name of the challenge is Git Good, so there must be something related to git. If we were to be able to access the .git folder for that website, we could maybe gain access to the website source code, and maybe even the flag. ON digging some more, we find /.git/COMMIT_EDITMSG and /admin.html. We can use GitTools to dump and extract files from the remote .git folder.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://anandrajaram21.github.io/blog/introduction/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 13:49:14 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://anandrajaram21.github.io/blog/introduction/</guid><description>First off, whoami? Well, I am Anand Rajaram. I am a student of Class 12 studying in Bangalore, India. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language i ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and JavaScript.
My first introduction to computer science was surprisingly through a prank on Facebook. This was when I was 13 years old.</description></item></channel></rss>
