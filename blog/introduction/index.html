Well, I am Anand Rajaram. I am a student of Class 12 studying in Bangalore, India. I started programming at the age of 14, and have loved it ever since. The first language I ever learnt was Java, after which my focus shifted primarily to Python and JavaScript.</p><p>My first introduction to computer science was surprisingly through a prank on Facebook. This was when I was 13 years old. It was a post that said &ldquo;Run the following command in your macOS terminal to hack anyone&rsquo;s Facebook password <code>sudo rm -rf /</code>&rdquo;. I ran this on my dad&rsquo;s Mac, and there began my journey into computer science. Luckily my dad had a Time Machine backup, so everything was back to normal. I eventually started to explore what that command actually did, and got into learning Linux. After that, I just continued to learn whatever excited me the most then.</p><p>Fast forward to April, 2021, when I started to explore the world of cybersecurity. Everything here was so damn interesting, that I just could not stop learning more. The world of CTFs caught my eye. I went ahead and tried my hand at a few web CTFs, as I had some prior web development experience. I failed at most of them, but isn&rsquo;t that how we all learn? Within the span of one month, I learnt more about web app security, binary exploitation and other CTF topics, and was soon able to solve beginner level CTF challenges, and some harder ones too!</p><p>This blog will contain writeups to CTF challenges that I was able to solve, or ones that I found particularly interesting. These will explain everything from a beginners perspective, so as to make it easy to understand for everyone who has a background in tech.</p><p>PS: If you stumble upon this website, feel free to take a look at my <a href=https://github.com/anandrajaram21 target=_blank rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub profile</a>
